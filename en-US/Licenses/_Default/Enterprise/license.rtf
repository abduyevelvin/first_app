\'b7\tab\ul Worldwide Use of the Media Center\ulnone\b . \b0 Media Center is not designed for use in every country. For example, although the Media Center information may refer to certain features such as an electronic programming guide or provide information on how to configure a TV tuner, these features may not work in your area. Please refer to the Media Center information for a list of features that may not work in your area.\f0\fs24\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\fi-360\li360\sb120\sa120\tx360\tx720\b\f1\fs20 3.\tab MANDATORY ACTIVATION.  \b0 The purpose of activation is to prevent unlicensed use of the software.  Activation occurs automatically the first time you use the software if the licensed computer is connected to the Internet.  If you cannot activate the software when you first use it, the software will periodically remind you to activate it.\b  You may not bypass or circumvent activation.  \par
\pard\nowidctlpar\fi-360\li360\sb120\sa120\tx720\tx810\tab a.  How it Works.  \b0 Activation associates the use of the software with a specific computer, and verifies that the software has been properly licensed and contains no unauthorized changes to the licensing or activation functions of the software. The software will notify you whether the installed copy of the software is properly licensed. During activation, the software will send information about the software and your computer to Microsoft. This information includes the version, language and product key of the software, the Internet protocol address of the computer, and information derived from the hardware configuration of the computer. For more information about activation, see go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=190175. Microsoft does not use the information to identify or contact you. If the licensed computer is connected to the Internet, the software will automatically connect to Microsoft for activation. \par
\pard\nowidctlpar\fi-360\li360\sb120\sa120\tx360\tx720\b\tab b.  Re-activation. \b0 Changes to your computer components or the software may require re-activation of the software.  The same information that is sent to Microsoft during activation may also be sent during re-activation.\par
\b\tab c.  Activation Failure.  \b0 The software will notify you if the installed copy of the software is improperly licensed or includes unauthorized changes.  In addition, you may receive reminders to obtain a properly licensed copy of the software. If that happens, you may not be able to obtain certain updates or upgrades from Microsoft.\par
\b\tab d.  Updates and Upgrades.  \b0 You may only obtain updates or upgrades for the software from Microsoft or authorized sources. For more information on obtaining updates from authorized sources see go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=104612.\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\li360\sb120\sa120\tx360\b e.  Customization.  \b0 Some of the information collected during activation is sent to Microsoft after activation to provide customized services to you.  For example, services such as the Windows Error Reporting and the Windows Store send some of this information in order to provide services customized for the type of computer hardware that is running this software.  For more information, see go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=190175.\f0\fs24\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\fi-360\li360\sb120\sa120\tx360\b\f1\fs20 4.\tab POTENTIALLY UNWANTED SOFTWARE. \b0 If turned on, Windows Defender will search your computer for \ldblquote spyware,\rdblquote  \ldblquote adware\rdblquote  and other potentially unwanted software. If it finds potentially unwanted software, the software will ask you if you want to ignore, disable (quarantine) or remove it. Any potentially unwanted software rated \ldblquote high\rdblquote  or \ldblquote severe,\rdblquote  will automatically be removed after scanning. Removing or disabling potentially unwanted software may result in\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\fi-360\li720\sb120\sa120\tx720\'b7\tab other software on your computer ceasing to work, or\par
\'b7\tab your breaching a license to use other software on your computer.\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\li360\sb120\sa120\tx360 By using this software, it is possible that you will also remove or disable software that is not potentially unwanted software.\f0\fs24\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\fi-360\li360\sb120\sa120\tx360\b\f1\fs20 5.\tab INTERNET-BASED SERVICES AND COMPONENTS.\b0  Microsoft provides Internet-based services and components with the software. Some of those services and components may be delivered at a later date via Windows Update--if, for example, you acquire an application that relies on one of those services or components.\b\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\fi-360\li720\tx720 a.\tab Consent for Internet-Based Services.\b0  The software features described below and in the Windows Privacy Statement connect to Microsoft or service provider computer systems over the Internet. In some cases, you will not receive a separate notice when they connect. In some cases, you may switch off these features or not use them. For more information about these features, see the Windows Privacy Statement at go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=190175. \b By using these features, you consent to the transmission of this information.\b0  Microsoft does not use the information to identify or contact you.\par
\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\li720\tx720\ul Computer Information\ulnone . The following features use Internet protocols, which send to the appropriate systems computer information, such as your Internet protocol address, the type of operating system, browser and name and version of the software you are using, and the language code of the computer where you installed the software. Microsoft uses this information to make the Internet-based services available to you.\par
\par

\par
\'b7\tab\ul Digital Certificates\ulnone . The software uses digital certificates. These digital certificates confirm the identity of Internet users sending X.509 standard encrypted information. They also can be used to digitally sign files and macros, to verify the integrity and origin of the file contents. The software retrieves certificates and updates certificate revocation lists over the Internet, when available.\par
\par
\'b7\tab\ul Auto Root Update\ulnone . The Auto Root Update feature updates the list of trusted certificate authorities. You can switch off the Auto Root Update feature.\par
\par
\'b7\tab\ul Windows Digital Rights Management Technology\ulnone . Content owners use digital rights management technology, including Windows Media Digital Rights Management (WMDRM), to protect their intellectual property, including copyrights. This software and third party software use this technology to play and copy protected content. If the software fails to protect the content, content owners may ask Microsoft to revoke the software\rquote s ability to use protection technology to play or copy protected content. Revocation does not affect other content. When you download licenses for protected content, you agree that Microsoft may include a revocation list with the licenses. Content owners may require you to upgrade Windows DRM technology to access their content. Microsoft software that includes DRM will ask for your consent prior to the upgrade. If you decline an upgrade, you will not be able to access content that requires the upgrade. You may choose not to use applications that make use of DRM features that access the Internet. When these features are off, you can still play content for which you have a valid license.\par
\b\par
\b0\'b7\tab\ul Windows Media Player\ulnone . When you use Windows Media Player, it checks with Microsoft for\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\li1080\'b7\tab compatible online music services in your region; and\par

\f1\'b7\tab\ul Malicious Software Removal\ulnone . If you select \ldblquote Get important updates\rdblquote  during setup, or afterwards, the software may check and remove certain malware from your computer. \ldblquote Malware\rdblquote  is malicious software. If the software runs, it will remove the Malware listed and updated at www.support.microsoft.com/?kbid=890830. During a Malware check, a report will be sent to Microsoft with specific information about Malware detected, errors, and other information about your computer. This information is used to improve the software and other Microsoft products and services. No information included in these reports will be used to identify or contact you. You may disable the software\rquote s reporting functionality by following the instructions found at www.support.microsoft.com/?kbid=890830. For more information, read the Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool privacy statement at go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=113995.\par
\par
\'b7\tab\ul Network Awareness\ulnone . This feature determines whether a system is connected to a network by either passive monitoring of network traffic or active DNS or HTTP queries. The query only transfers standard TCP/IP or DNS information for routing purposes. You can switch off the active query feature through a registry setting.\par
\par
\'b7\tab\ul Windows Time Service\ulnone . This service synchronizes with time.windows.com once a week to provide your computer with the correct time.

\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\fi-360\li1080\tx4125\'b7\tab\ul IPv6 Network Address Translation (NAT) Traversal service (Teredo)\ulnone . Each time you start your computer, Teredo will attempt to locate a public Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) service on the Internet. This occurs automatically when your computer is connected to a public or private network, but does not occur on managed networks such as enterprise domains. If you use a program that requires Teredo to use IPv6 connectivity, or if you configure your firewall to always enable IPv6 connectivity, then Teredo will periodically contact the Microsoft Teredo service over the Internet. The only information sent to Microsoft is standard computer information and the name of the service requested (for example teredo.ipv6.microsoft.com). The information sent from your computer by Teredo is used to determine if your computer is connected to the Internet and if it can locate a public IPv6 service. Once the service is located, information is sent to maintain a connection with the IPv6 service.\par
